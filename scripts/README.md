# Local Scripts

These scripts are intended for local use and are not part of CI. Node.js is required, and dev tools like `nodemon` are installed with `npm install`.

Node.js is required to run the scripts in this folder. Install it globally using your preferred method. Two common options are:

With nvm (macOS/Linux):

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

With Homebrew (macOS):

```sh
brew install node
```

## Build the site

```sh
npm run build
```

The build script writes the site output only. Prose linting is a separate step you run when you want it.

## Build on change and serve

```sh
npm start
```

This runs the lint report, builds the site, starts the local server, and rebuilds on changes in `content/` and `config/`. By default the dev server binds to `127.0.0.1`; set `HOST=0.0.0.0` if you need to reach it from another device, and override the port with `PORT=xxxx` if needed.

The dev loop prints a short status line when lint and build succeed. Lint issues are reported without stopping the server.

## Lint prose in drafts

The prose linter scans `content/**/article.md` when `/content/` exists. If not, it falls back to `example/**/article.md`.
It only prints output when it finds issues.

Rules, thresholds, and metrics live in `config/prose-lint.json`. You can disable a rule by setting `"enabled": false`. CLI flags still override config values.

```sh
npm run lint
```

To include published posts:

```sh
npm run lint -- --all
```

To enforce thresholds (useful for CI):

```sh
npm run lint -- --all --gate
```

Defaults are per file: high>=1, medium>=3, low>=6. You can override them:

```sh
npm run lint -- --all --gate --max-high=1 --max-medium=2 --max-low=5
```

If you want fail-fast instead of thresholds:

```sh
npm run lint -- --all --strict
```

When the dev build emits warnings or lint issues, it also writes `temp/build-report.json` with the combined warnings and lint report. This gives the preview UI one place to read diagnostics without stopping the server.
