      <h1>Start Here: Building the Tool While Using It</h1>
<p><em>January 9, 2026</em> | Tags: #publishing, #process, #tooling | Stream: genesis</p>
<p>This project exists to test a new model of software development and content production in public. The repository is both the lab and the record, and the system I am building will publish the discoveries that come out of its own construction.</p>
<p>The first content is the documentation process itself. That is why I am writing this as I build: the conversation, the decisions, the constraints, and the contradictions are the raw material. The Q/A process I am working out here is the real work. It becomes the content.</p>
<p>Over time, this back-and-forth will harden into scripts. Today it is a dialogue. Tomorrow it becomes a command. As it stabilizes, the workflow gets more consistent and the content aligns more closely with the system it describes. That is the point of doing it in the open: the system proves itself by publishing its own formation.</p>
<p>I want to minimize imports and treat third-party tools as last resorts. If the problem can be solved cleanly in a small amount of code, I do it myself and I understand it. If that stops being true, I bring in a dependency with intention and say why.</p>
<p>On the publishing side, I am aiming for the most boring convention that still works: a home page index with the newest post at the top, and a dedicated article page for each post with a stable permalink. That is the shape of the site I want to live inside.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the genesis stream. The next posts will move through the philosophy and the mechanics, but they will stay grounded in the same principle: build the tool while using it, and let the system explain itself in real time.</p>
