    <h1>Start Here: Building the Tool While Using It</h1>
<p><em>January 9, 2026</em> | Tags: #publishing, #process, #tooling | Stream: genesis</p>
<p>This project exists to test a new model of software development and content production in public. The repository is both the lab and the record, and the system we are building will publish the discoveries that come out of its own construction.</p>
<p>The first content is the documentation process itself. That is why I am writing this as I build: the conversation, the decisions, the constraints, and the contradictions are the raw material. The Q/A process we are working out together is not a prelude to the real work. It is the real work, and it becomes the content.</p>
<p>Over time, this back-and-forth will harden into scripts. Today it is a dialogue. Tomorrow it becomes a command. As it stabilizes, the workflow gets more consistent and the content aligns more closely with the system it describes. That is the point of doing it in the open: the system proves itself by publishing its own formation.</p>
<p>I want to minimize imports and treat third-party tools as last resorts, not defaults. If the problem can be solved cleanly in a small amount of code, we do it ourselves and we understand it. If that stops being true, we bring in a dependency with intention and say why.</p>
<p>On the publishing side, I am aiming for the most boring convention that still works: a home page index with the newest post at the top, and a dedicated article page for each post with a permalink that does not change. That is the shape of the site I want to live inside.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the genesis stream. The next posts will move through the philosophy and the mechanics, but they will stay grounded in the same principle: build the tool while using it, and let the system explain itself in real time.</p>
