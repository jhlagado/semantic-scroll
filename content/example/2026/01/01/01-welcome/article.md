# Welcome to Scribere
By Example Author

This is the example site that ships with the Scribere engine. It exists so you can run the build and see a real page without any extra setup. Replace these posts with your own writing once you are ready.

This system keeps content in dated folders and builds static pages from plain Markdown. If you delete this folder and add your own, the site will still work as long as you keep the same structure. The example is small on purpose so you can see how each piece fits.
