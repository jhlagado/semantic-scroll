# Blog Philosophy, Draft One
*January 12, 2026* | Series: genesis | Tags: philosophy, publishing, web, process

I write down the philosophy early because it shapes every later decision. A frictionless way to publish day to day technical work keeps AI drafting and me in control. A system that keeps momentum should not pull me into a UI.

I keep coming back to classic HTML and the original web idea from Tim Berners-Lee. A document should be legible without tooling, and a link should be a durable pointer, not a fragile runtime action. The site should feel like the early web did when it was a network of human readable documents.

I take accessibility and internationalisation seriously because a durable site has to be readable across time, devices, and languages. Headings, landmarks, and links need to make sense to assistive tools. Text and layout choices should not collapse when the language changes, when the font changes, or when a reader does not use a mouse.

I treat performance and cacheability as core design features. Pages should load fast on slow networks and stay responsive on old devices. I publish assets in a way that makes caching predictable, so the site feels light even when the archive grows.

I treat discoverability as a craft concern. Clean URLs, meaningful titles, and indexable pages should show their intent without JavaScript. SEO and AI visibility should follow from clear structure and honest metadata, without overlays or tricks.

I rely on unobtrusive JavaScript for navigation smoothing. I keep the app style impulse in check and protect the baseline page. Classic HTML remains the foundation even when enhancements exist.

I favor a minimal toolchain, native JavaScript, and a bias against dependency sprawl. I keep the feature scope tight and add theming and user settings only when they serve reading.

I insist on a clean, date based folder tree where each article lives in its own folder with its assets nearby. I use tags and summaries to build indexes that cut across chronology while keeping the archive legible.

This spec needs to grow by addenda in place of rewrites so the trail stays visible. I write the blog while building the blog, and that loop needs to stay clear.
