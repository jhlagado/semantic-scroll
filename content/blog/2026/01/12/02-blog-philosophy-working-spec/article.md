# Blog Philosophy, Draft One
*January 12, 2026* | Series: genesis | Tags: philosophy, publishing, web, process

I am writing down the philosophy early because it shapes every later decision. I want a frictionless way to publish day to day technical work, with AI drafting and me keeping control. I want a system that keeps momentum and does not pull me into a UI.

I keep coming back to classic HTML and the original web idea from Tim Berners-Lee. A document should be legible without tooling, and a link should be a durable pointer, not a fragile runtime action. I want the site to feel like the early web did when it was a network of human readable documents.

I take accessibility and internationalisation seriously because a durable site has to be readable across time, devices, and languages. I want headings, landmarks, and links that make sense to assistive tools. I want text and layout choices that do not collapse when the language changes, when the font changes, or when a reader does not use a mouse.

I treat performance and cacheability as core design features. I want pages that load fast on slow networks and stay responsive on old devices. I want to publish assets in a way that makes caching predictable, so the site feels light even when the archive grows.

I treat discoverability as part of the craft. I want clean URLs, meaningful titles, and indexable pages that show their intent without JavaScript. I want SEO and AI visibility to follow from clear structure and honest metadata, without overlays or tricks.

I rely on unobtrusive JavaScript for navigation smoothing. I keep the app style impulse in check and protect the baseline page. Classic HTML remains the foundation even when enhancements exist.

I favor a minimal toolchain, native JavaScript, and a bias against dependency sprawl. I keep the feature scope tight and add theming and user settings only when they serve reading.

I insist on a clean, date based folder tree where each article lives in its own folder with its assets nearby. I use tags and summaries to build indexes that cut across chronology while keeping the archive legible.

I want this spec to grow by addenda rather than rewrites so the trail stays visible. I am writing the blog while building the blog, and I want that loop to stay clear.
