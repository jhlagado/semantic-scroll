# The Blog Is the Build System
*January 10, 2026* | Series: genesis | Tags: publishing, process, tooling

At some point in this project I noticed a shift. I wanted a place to put things while I worked; I ended up with a repository that changes shape every time I write. A new tag, a new series, a new way of ordering days rewires how everything else fits together.

Each article lands as a directory, a file, and a set of paths that must make sense to the rest of the site. Dates, ordinals, summaries, and queries grow out of publishing, and each decision about finding becomes structure. The writing leaves a footprint the build process has to respect.

That feedback loop is the project. I write because I am thinking, and the system changes because I wrote. Over time, patterns settle into scripts and conventions. A conversation becomes a command. A rough workflow turns into a repeatable one. Automation keeps what survived the thinking and makes it easier to run again.

This is why I keep everything visible and plain. Files, folders, and JSON keep the state legible at a glance, and a change sits in the open where I can see it later. The Git history carries the shape of those decisions like tree rings carry droughts and growth spurts.

What emerges is a site that documents its own construction by existing. Each post advances both the story and the machinery that tells it. Reading backward through the archive shows how the system took on its current form, one day and one choice at a time. That trail is what I am trying to keep.
