summary: "This project is a self-referential experiment in software development that uses public writing to shape the system as it forms. This first post explains how the live Q/A workflow hardens into tooling and replaces itself over time."

# Start Here: Building the Tool While Using It
_January 9, 2026_ | Series: genesis

This project exists to test a new model of software development and content production in public. The repository is both the lab and the record, and the system I am building will publish the discoveries that come out of its own construction.

The first content is the documentation process itself, so I write while I build and treat the conversation and decisions as raw material with constraints and contradictions kept visible. The Q/A process I am working out here is the real work, and it becomes the content.

Over time, this back-and-forth will harden into scripts as the workflow stabilises and the content aligns with the system it describes. The point of doing it in the open is that the system proves itself by publishing its own formation, so the diary becomes the tool.

I minimise imports and treat third-party tools as last resorts. If I can solve a problem cleanly in a small amount of code, I do it myself and I understand it. If that stops being true, I bring in a dependency with intention and say why.

On the publishing side, I am aiming for the most boring convention that still works: a home page index with the newest post at the top. Each post also gets a dedicated article page with a stable permalink. That is the shape of the site I want to live inside.

This is the beginning of the genesis series. The next posts will move through the philosophy and the mechanics, but they will stay grounded in the same principle: build the tool while using it so the system explains itself in real time.
