# Writing Fast Without Writing Sloppily
*January 9, 2026* | Series: genesis | Tags: writing, process, tooling, automation

Writing quickly matters to this project. Without it I'd slow down and publish less. The pace is part of the experiment: ideas form in real time, I'm making decisions under pressure, and the value is in capturing them while they're still alive. That creates tension: speed pulls me toward shortcuts and familiar phrasing that drain the work of voice.

It's easy to slide into that. Certain phrases arrive fully formed. Sentences drift into explanation and leave description behind. Paragraphs climb into commentary about the writing. Language has grooves, and when I'm moving fast, it's tempting to let the wheels fall into them.

Automation helps here, even though it's awkward. I don't believe there's a reliable way to algorithmically judge good writing, and I'm not trying to invent one. What I do think is possible is to detect laziness: repetition, familiar scaffolding, verbal tics when attention drops, passive blur, and phrases that announce ideas before they arrive. These patterns show up quickly.

Part of this project will involve writing local scripts that scan prose and score it for those habits. The scripts are friction: no rewrites, no house style, just a mirror. If a draft trips too many signals, that's my cue to slow down and look again. The tooling doesn't decide what's good.

There's something slightly perverse about using code to guard against formulaic writing, but it fits the larger theme here. Staying awake is the point. Fast writing only helps when it still sounds like someone thinking, without the shape-filling feel of a system. A bit of automation that keeps me honest while I move quickly feels like a fair trade.

*In case it wasn't obvious, yes of course I will be employing AI to help me write and help me review my text content. Learning how to do this in a timely manner without producing soulless slop is one of the big challenges of this project and one of the design goals is to help me as the writer use the assistance of AI without ever putting it in the driver's seat.*

*Steve Jobs once said "the computer is like a bicycle for the mind". The way I've been thinking about it lately, AI is like an e-bike for mine. Let's hope it doesn't drive me into a ditch!*
