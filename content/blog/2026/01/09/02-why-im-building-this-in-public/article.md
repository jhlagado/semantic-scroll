# Why I'm Building This in Public
_January 9, 2026_ | Series: genesis

I'm building this in public because writing details down changes how I think. When ideas stay private they remain vague and provisional. When I write for others, even an imagined reader, the ideas sharpen. Assumptions surface and decisions harden, which is where the gaps show.

This repository is where I'm working decisions out and where those workings live. The notes and specs sit beside the code they shape, with half-decisions and revisions kept close by. They stay inside the process, present while I shape the code.

The writing is one of the tools I'm using to build the system. It affects the choices I make and keeps the work accountable because it has to be readable to someone besides me.

If you want the companion piece on pace and voice, read [Writing Fast Without Writing Sloppily](/content/blog/2026/01/09/03-writing-fast-without-writing-sloppily/).

A central concern in the experiment is how AI fits into this. I want AI as a constrained collaborator with clear boundaries about authority and intent, along with what I allow to change. Those constraints preserve the shape of the work while still letting me use speed and advantage when they help.

The blog that will appear here comes from the project and follows the same rules. As the repository grows, the system that publishes it will grow alongside it. Templates and queries will show up alongside build scripts and deployment, because the writing needs them.

I still work out my position, and I take my time with it. This is an attempt to think carefully and design slowly while leaving a readable trail behind. The trail should stand on its own, even if I am the only person who ever reads it end to end.
